## Initial Approach
My main idea was to look at **techstacks** that I am going to be using as they serve the base for project results, a good techstack leads to an optimized build cycle.
(refer to techstack used in [README.md](https://github.com/vineet-k09/event_management/blob/main/README.md))

1. I looked at my options based on the project requirements.

2. Instead of letting AI (ChatGPT) suggest me what to do, I instead try to look at my possible options and compare them with what the project actually demands.
3. Looking at Pros & Cons (see below) is a good way to decide.

## Database
After the techstack is decided, the backbone of the application has to be woven into a usefull shape.
1. In general I try to divide the data we will be handling into static tables (That create data independently, like Users, University) and dynamics (That create data dependently on other tables, like registration, as it relies on data from user, university and event, and each entry is an atomic row) <br />

2. Having a clear approach let's you understand the shortcomings of your approach

## Conclusion
- Rest of the conversation can be seen in the ChatGPT chat link on the top of this file.
- Primarily instead of deviating from the decision of the model, I try to have common ground between our choices, in other terms **if you can convince an AI about your idea then its not a bad idea.**
- Rest of the code was generated by ChatGPT as well, while styling and layout was typed out by me.
- p.s. Ignore the spelling mistakes as the typing in chats were rushed.
